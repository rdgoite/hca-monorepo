The columns of the rpkm and the counts have the same order with the sample IDs. Columns 1:3514 correspond to rpkm values, Columns 3515:7028 correspond to read counts. Rows 1:26179 correspond to data for RefSeq genes, Rows 26180:26271 correspond to data for the 92 external RNA spike-in controls (ERCCs), Row 26272 (last) contains data for \u2018eGFP\u2019."
